# Active Context: LeetCode Problem Analyzer & Tutor

## 1. Current Work Focus

*   **Phase:** UI Refinement.
*   **Objective:** Improve the user interface by implementing a tabbed layout for the "Solutions" and "Similar Problems" sections and fixing various styling issues.
*   **Current Activity:** Finalizing the memory bank update after successfully implementing the new UI.

## 2. Recent Changes & Accomplishments

*   **Backend Stabilized:**
    *   Refactored all LLM-related prompts in `backend/app/llm_service.py` to be more robust and less prone to generating invalid JSON.
    *   Implemented a more flexible JSON parser in `_call_llm` to handle both objects and lists.
    *   Added file-based caching for all LLM calls to improve performance and reduce cost.
    *   Added comprehensive exception logging with stack traces to all backend endpoints in `main.py`.
    *   Made the Gemini model name configurable via the `.env` file.
*   **Frontend UI Refinements (Successful):**
    *   **Implemented Tabbed Interface:** Added a Materialize tabbed layout for the "Solutions" and "Similar Problems" sections in `frontend/index.html`.
    *   **Corrected DOM Manipulation Logic:** Fixed a critical bug in `frontend/script.js` where the parent container's `innerHTML` was being cleared, which detached the child elements from the DOM before they could be populated.
    *   **Fixed Styling Issues:** Resolved various styling issues in `frontend/style.css`, including removing extra borders and fixing a scrollbar issue.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Finalize Memory Bank Update:** Complete the review and update of all memory bank files.
2.  **Address Git Repository Corruption:** Resolve the corrupted `.git` directory issue.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Client-Side Orchestration:** The frontend is now more complex as it manages the state and flow of multiple parallel API calls. This is a trade-off for a more resilient and responsive UI.
*   **Caching Strategy:** The LLM caching was removed in favor of a simpler in-memory cache for the scraped problem data only. This simplifies the backend but means LLM calls are not persisted between server restarts. This is a known issue to be addressed.
*   **Error Handling:** The frontend now has more sophisticated error handling to manage per-section failures and retries. The backend prompts have also been made more explicit to reduce the likelihood of LLM-induced errors.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

*   **Backend Robustness:** The backend has been hardened significantly by simplifying prompts and manually constructing the final data structures in the service layer before returning them. This is a preferred pattern for working with unreliable LLMs.
*   **Incremental Debugging:** The use of console logs and debuggers was essential in tracing the flow of data and identifying the point of failure in the frontend.
*   **Careful with Frameworks:** The Materialize CSS framework required careful handling of its tab initialization and container structure to avoid rendering issues.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights

*   **Frontend Frameworks Obscure Behavior:** The interaction between the JavaScript code and the Materialize CSS framework likely caused the rendering issue. The exact cause is still unknown, but it highlights the difficulty of debugging issues that may be internal to a framework.
*   **DOM Manipulation is Tricky:** The bug where child elements were being detached from the DOM by clearing the parent's `innerHTML` is a classic and subtle JavaScript issue. It emphasizes the need for careful state management when manipulating the DOM.
*   **Backend is Solid:** The extensive logging and testing have confirmed that the backend is working as expected. The issue is now definitively isolated to the frontend.
