# Progress: LeetCode Problem Analyzer & Tutor

## 1. Current Project Status

*   **Overall Status:** UI Refined and Chat Widget Stabilized.
*   **Current Milestone:** The application's UI has been refined with a tabbed layout and the chat widget's interactivity and layout issues have been resolved. The memory bank is being updated to reflect these changes.

## 2. What Works (Actual)

*   **Stable Backend:** The backend is robust. It correctly scrapes data, calls the LLM, caches the results, and serves the data through its API endpoints. Extensive logging and testing have confirmed its stability.
*   **Complete Frontend Rendering:** All sections, including "Problem Analysis", "Detailed Explanation", "Resources", and "Similar Problems", render correctly on the frontend with improved formatting.
*   **Interactive Chat Widget:** The chat widget is now fully interactive and displays Markdown-formatted responses from the LLM.
*   **Data Flow:** The frontend correctly receives data for all sections from the backend. This has been verified with console logs.

## 3. Evolution of Project Decisions (Post-Refactoring Summary)

*   **Initial Architecture:** A single backend endpoint (`/api/analyze_problem`) triggered a monolithic LLM call to generate all content at once.
    *   **Problem:** This was brittle. A failure in any part of the LLM's response would cause the entire request to fail. It also led to poor perceived performance as the user had to wait for everything to be generated.
*   **Refactored Architecture (Current):**
    *   **Decision:** Moved to a **parallel, lazy-loading** model.
    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  Created a dedicated `/api/scrape` endpoint.
        2.  Broke the monolithic endpoint into five granular endpoints (`/api/analysis`, `/api/explanation`, etc.).
        3.  Rewrote the frontend to orchestrate parallel calls to these new endpoints.
    *   **Result:** A more resilient and responsive user experience, but with increased frontend complexity.
*   **Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Initial:** File-based cache for the entire LLM response.
    *   **Current:** Removed the LLM cache and implemented a simple in-memory cache for the scraping endpoint only. This was a temporary measure during the refactor and is noted as a key issue to address.
*   **UI and Chat Widget Improvements:**
    *   Implemented a tabbed interface for the main content sections.
    *   Integrated the `marked` library to render Markdown content in the "Detailed Explanation" section and the chat window.
    *   Fixed layout and interactivity issues with the chat widget.
*   **Error Handling & Debugging:**
    *   Fixed multiple Python path and dependency issues (`ModuleNotFoundError`, Pydantic `TypeError`).
    *   Made backend prompts significantly more explicit to ensure valid JSON.
    *   Added a robust JSON parsing function to the backend to handle minor LLM output errors.
    *   Implemented a frontend retry mechanism and improved the logic to handle cases where the API returns a 200 OK status but with empty data.
