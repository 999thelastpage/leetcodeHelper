# Progress: LeetCode Problem Analyzer & Tutor

## 1. Current Project Status

*   **Overall Status:** Architecturally Refactored.
*   **Current Milestone:** The application has been significantly refactored from a monolithic backend to a parallel, lazy-loading architecture. The core functionality is in place, but there are known issues to be addressed. The Memory Bank is now up-to-date with the new design.

## 2. What Works (Actual)

*   **Stable Backend:** The backend is robust. It correctly scrapes data, calls the LLM, caches the results, and serves the data through its API endpoints. Extensive logging and testing have confirmed its stability.
*   **Partial Frontend Rendering:** The "Problem Analysis", "Detailed Explanation", and "Resources" sections render correctly on the frontend.
*   **Data Flow:** The frontend correctly receives data for all sections from the backend. This has been verified with console logs.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Current Known Issues)

*   **Git Repository Corruption:** The `.git` directory is corrupted, which prevents the `attempt_completion` tool from working. This needs to be resolved.

## 4. Evolution of Project Decisions (Post-Refactoring Summary)

*   **Initial Architecture:** A single backend endpoint (`/api/analyze_problem`) triggered a monolithic LLM call to generate all content at once.
    *   **Problem:** This was brittle. A failure in any part of the LLM's response would cause the entire request to fail. It also led to poor perceived performance as the user had to wait for everything to be generated.
*   **Refactored Architecture (Current):**
    *   **Decision:** Moved to a **parallel, lazy-loading** model.
    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  Created a dedicated `/api/scrape` endpoint.
        2.  Broke the monolithic endpoint into five granular endpoints (`/api/analysis`, `/api/explanation`, etc.).
        3.  Rewrote the frontend to orchestrate parallel calls to these new endpoints.
    *   **Result:** A more resilient and responsive user experience, but with increased frontend complexity.
*   **Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Initial:** File-based cache for the entire LLM response.
    *   **Current:** Removed the LLM cache and implemented a simple in-memory cache for the scraping endpoint only. This was a temporary measure during the refactor and is noted as a key issue to address.
*   **Error Handling & Debugging:**
    *   Fixed multiple Python path and dependency issues (`ModuleNotFoundError`, Pydantic `TypeError`).
    *   Made backend prompts significantly more explicit to ensure valid JSON.
    *   Added a robust JSON parsing function to the backend to handle minor LLM output errors.
    *   Implemented a frontend retry mechanism and improved the logic to handle cases where the API returns a 200 OK status but with empty data.
