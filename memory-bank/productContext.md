# Product Context: LeetCode Problem Analyzer & Tutor

## 1. Problem Statement

Many individuals, from students to experienced developers, use platforms like LeetCode to practice coding skills, prepare for technical interviews, and deepen their understanding of data structures and algorithms. However, they often face challenges:

*   **Understanding Complex Problems:** Some LeetCode problems can be difficult to grasp initially, with nuanced requirements or tricky edge cases.
*   **Finding Intuitive Solutions:** While official solutions or community discussions exist, they might not always be presented in the most intuitive or step-by-step manner for all learners.
*   **Identifying Quality Learning Resources:** Sifting through numerous online resources (articles, videos, tutorials) to find high-quality, relevant supplementary material can be time-consuming.
*   **Reinforcing Learning:** After solving a problem, it's beneficial to tackle similar problems with slight variations to solidify understanding, but identifying appropriate follow-up problems isn't always straightforward.
*   **Lack of Interactive Guidance:** Static solutions and resources don't allow for interactive questioning or exploration of "what if" scenarios related to the problem.

## 2. Proposed Solution

The "LeetCode Problem Analyzer & Tutor" web application aims to address these challenges by providing an LLM-powered assistant (Gemini Pro 2.5) that offers:

*   **Deep Problem Deconstruction:** The LLM will analyze a given LeetCode problem (from a URL) and break it down into understandable components.
*   **Multi-Language, Explained Solutions:** The LLM will generate not just correct, but also intuitively explained solutions in Python, Java, and C++, complete with a detailed pattern analysis.
*   **High-Quality, Obscure Resources:** The LLM will find and suggest a list of high-quality, hard-to-find external links for a deeper understanding of the concepts.
*   **Targeted Practice:** The LLM will recommend similar problems to help users reinforce their learning.
*   **Interactive Dialogue:** A floating, minimizable chat widget allows users to engage in a conversation with the LLM about the specific problem.

## 3. Target Users

*   **Students:** Learning data structures and algorithms for academic purposes.
*   **Aspiring Software Engineers:** Preparing for technical interviews.
*   **Experienced Developers:** Brushing up on specific topics or exploring new problem-solving techniques.
*   **Self-Learners:** Anyone looking to improve their coding and problem-solving skills through platforms like LeetCode.

## 4. Value Proposition

*   **Accelerated Learning:** By providing clear explanations, curated resources, and targeted practice, the tool helps users learn more effectively and efficiently.
*   **Deeper Understanding:** The interactive chat and in-depth analysis foster a more profound comprehension of problem-solving techniques and underlying principles.
*   **Increased Confidence:** Successfully navigating complex problems with the aid of the tutor can boost user confidence in their coding abilities.
*   **Personalized Assistance:** The LLM can adapt its explanations and guidance to a certain extent, offering a more personalized learning experience than static resources.

## 5. User Experience Goals

*   **Intuitive and Simple Interface:** Users should be able to easily submit a LeetCode problem and access the generated analysis and resources.
*   **Clear and Actionable Information:** The output (solution, resources, similar problems) should be presented in a well-organized and easy-to-digest format.
*   **Responsive and Engaging Chat:** The floating chat widget should be intuitive and easy to use.
*   **Trustworthy and Accurate Content:** Users should feel confident in the accuracy of the solutions and the quality of the recommended resources.
*   **Performance:** The application should feel responsive, aided by the caching of LLM responses.
