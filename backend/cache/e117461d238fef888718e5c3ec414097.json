    "analysis": "The core challenge is not algorithmic complexity but the meticulous, step-by-step implementation of a string parsing state machine. This involves robustly handling numerous edge cases: leading whitespace, optional signs, non-digit characters, and empty or invalid inputs. The most critical aspect is detecting and handling integer overflow/underflow *before* it occurs during the digit accumulation phase, ensuring the final result is correctly clamped to the 32-bit signed integer range. The solution requires no advanced data structures, just simple variables for an index, sign, and the result, processed through a direct iteration over the input string with careful conditional logic."
