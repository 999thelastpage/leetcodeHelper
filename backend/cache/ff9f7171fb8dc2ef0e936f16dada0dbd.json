    "analysis": "The core challenge is to efficiently find the complement (`target - x`) for each element `x` in the array. A brute-force search using nested loops results in an O(n^2) time complexity, which is too slow. The key to an optimal solution is to use a hash table to achieve a time-space tradeoff. By iterating through the array a single time, we can use the hash table to store numbers we have already seen and their indices. For each element, we can then perform an O(1) average-time lookup to check if its complement exists in the hash table, leading to an overall O(n) time complexity solution at the cost of O(n) space."
