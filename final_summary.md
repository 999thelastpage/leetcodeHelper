# Final Summary: Frontend Refinements and Bug Fixes

This document summarizes the work completed to resolve the frontend rendering issues and improve the user interface of the LeetCode Problem Analyzer & Tutor application.

## 1. Frontend Rendering Bug Fixes

*   **Identified the Root Cause:** The primary issue was that the JavaScript code was clearing the `innerHTML` of the parent containers for the "Solutions" and "Similar Problems" sections, which detached the child elements from the DOM before they could be populated.
*   **Corrected DOM Manipulation Logic:** The `clearResults()` and `displaySection()` functions in `frontend/script.js` were modified to prevent them from clearing the container's `innerHTML` for the "Solutions" and "Similar Problems" sections.

## 2. UI Refinements

*   **Implemented Tabbed Interface:** A Materialize tabbed layout was implemented for the "Solutions" and "Similar Problems" sections in `frontend/index.html` to improve the user experience.
*   **Fixed Styling Issues:** Various styling issues in `frontend/style.css` were resolved, including removing extra borders and fixing a scrollbar issue.

## 3. Memory Bank Update

*   The `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` files in the `memory-bank` directory were updated to reflect the changes made and the resolution of the UI issues.

## 4. Git Repository Issue

*   The `attempt_completion` tool is failing due to a corrupted Git repository. Multiple attempts to re-initialize the repository were unsuccessful. This issue needs to be addressed separately.
